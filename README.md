# WAM Armor Kiosk
    
The kiosk uses Kiosk Pro Plus to operate and runs entirely from local files within the Kiosk Pro Plus app stored on the iPad.

In order to update:
1. Make, commit, and push changes
2. Download new version into a zip file
3. Unzip the file -> new folder
4. Connect your computer to the iPad and upload files to the iPad under Kiosk Pro Plus
5. The app should be updated; if the app did not update, make sure the folder name and file path name (in Kiosk Pro Plus settings) match

To upload/change videos:
All videos are stored locally on the iPad. Video files should be named as follows: 
top left -> armor-1.mp4
top right-> armor-2.mp4
bottom left -> armor-3.mp4
bottom right -> armor-4.mp4
*videos must be named accordingly and be in mp4 format in order to be read
